# Hi there üëã 

## I'm Dave, a London-based full-stack developer. 
I recently completed a 4 month Makers Bootcamp - taking the specialist track in software development. Beyond the fundamentals of Python and Javascript, the bootcamp focused on the Golden Square principles (test driven development, object-oriented design, debugging and pair programming), alongside best practices for the design and building of databases and web applications.

Prior to Makers, I participated in Stanford's annual 8-week Code In Place course.

## Languages, frameworks, libraries and web technologies I've used:

## My Makers Projects üíª
### [Roam Mates](https://github.com/SoundMotives/RoamMatesFork)
Roam Mates ‚Äúconnects like-minded travellers to explore the world! together‚Äù ‚Ä®We implemented a Python backend using Flask and PostgreSQL, with a Javascript and React frontend using JWT authentication. Collaboration was managed using Git, and testing was conducted using Pytest, Cypress and Playwright. Quality Engineer collaboration ensured the team built better software, and we learned a lot!

### [AceBook](https://github.com/SoundMotives/AceBook)
AceBook was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js). Collaboration was managed using Git, and testing was conducted using Cypress and Playwright.

### [Chitter] (https://github.com/SoundMotives/Chitter)
Chitter is a Twitter clone, built using Python, Flask, Jinja, PostgreSQL, CCS, HTML and HTTP.

### MakersBnB
MakersBNB is an AirBnB clone, built using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL. Collaboration was managed using Git, and testing was conducted using Pytest.

## Current Projects üíª
I'm building on the learnings from Roam Mates with a new project which takes a similar approach of Python backend and Javascript/React frontend, but incorporating Django into the backend, to continue expanding my learning and potentially speed up workflows in the future!  

## Previous Experience üìª
Formerly an award-winning Producer, Executive Producer and Editorial Consultant with over 15 years of audio experience, my career began in radio and podcasts. After refining my editorial and audio skills in these established formats, innovation and technology began playing an evermore central role in my work, participating in multidisciplinary teams developing synthetic voice experiences and innovation formats for broadcasters (BBC), publishers (The Guardian, The Financial Times), brands (Red Bull) and startups (Beams) - with synthetic voice technologies from Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Alexa at their core.

## Anything Else? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Having completed Makers Bootcamp, I'm now looking for a role where I might continue my personal development. My coding journey has been incredibly rewarding and invigorating so far, through relearning to learn once again. And I'm excited to continue developing.
